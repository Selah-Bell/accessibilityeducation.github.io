<h2>Learning Objectives</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Understand how heaps are implemented.</li>
        <li>Understand how to use multiple data structures simultaneously.</li>
        <li>Understand what the WCAG guidelines are and how to implement them.</li>
    </ol>
<h2>Assignment</h2>

    <h3>1. Overview</h3>
        <p>
            In this assignment, you will create a program that uses the heap data structure to run queries on a file containing the success criteria of the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1.
            These guidelines proved recommendations for making web content accessible to people with disabilities, such as blindness, deafness, limited movement, speech disabilities, photosensitivity,
            and learning disabilities. The success criteria have three levels of conformance — A, AA, and AAA — with level A being the minimum level.
        </p>
        <p> 
            For more information, you can refer to the official WCAG 2.1 guidelines on the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/">Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1</a> website.
        </p>
        <p>
            As WCAG 2.1 has a long list of requirements (success criteria) that are referenced by numbers, you program will provide an efficient way to navigate this list. The program consists of three
            phases, and it will allow you to easily query the WCAG success criteria by referencing their respective numbers. By the end of this assignment, you will have a useful tool for anyone looking
            to ensure their website meets accessibility standards and is accessible to everyone, regardless of their disabilities.
        </p>
        <p>
            This is a pair programming assignment, all design, development, and debugging must be done synchronously with your partner.
        </p>

        <h3>2. Phases</h3>

        <h4>Phase 1</h4>
        <p>
            This involves completing the implementation of a min-heap in the Heap.java file provided in the skeleton repository. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Find the Phase 1 ToDo's in the documentation provided with the assignment.
        </p>

        <h4>Phase 2</h4>
        <p>
            This phase involves completing HeapTester.java by utilizing your code from the previous phases. You will use a min-heap to organize the data contained in AccessibilityGuidelines.txt, which is
            a collection of data points based on the WCAG.
        </p>
        <p>
            Each guideline within AccessibilityGuidelines.txt comprises an index, a title, and a conformance level rating. The data point grouping is indicated by a 3-decimal number called the index. For
            instance, the first guideline is 1.1.1, followed by 1.1.2, and so on. The title provides a description of the contents. The conformance level, indicated by A, AA, or AAA, specifies the extent
            to which meeting the guideline would enhance a website's accessibility. Level A indicates the minimum level of accessibility, while level AAA indicates the highest level of excellence.
        </p>
        <p>
            The code to obtain these data points is already given in the <b>getAccessibilityGuidelines</b> function. It will return a 2D array and your task is to take the given data and apply it to your heap.
        </p>
        <p>
            Find the Phase 2 ToDo's in the documentation provided with the assignment.
        </p>

        <h4>Phase 3</h4>
        <p>
            This phase will utilize your heap to quickly access WCAG data.
        </p>
        <p>
            Find the Phase 3 ToDo's in the documentation provided with the assignment.
        </p>

        <h3>3. Project Plan and Reflection</h3>
        <p>
            Each person must write both a project plan named plan.txt and a reflection named reflection.txt. plan.txt must be completed before the start of the project and reflection.txt must be completed before
            submitting your project.
        </p>
        <p>
            plan.txt should include the following information:
            <ol>
                <li>A one paragraph summary of the program in your own words. What is being asked of you? What will you implement in this assignment?</li>
                <li>In 2-3 sentence, explain your thoughts on what you anticipate being the most challenging aspect(s) of the assignment.</li>
                <li>A proposed schedule for when you will work on this assignment with your partner and where you will meet.</li>
                <li>A list of at least 3 different resources you plan to use if you get stuck on something.</li>
            </ol>
            reflection.txt should include the following information:
            <ol>
                <li>Declare/discuss any aspects of your code that are not working. What are your intuitions about why they are not working? Acknowledge and discuss any parts of the program that appear to be
                    inefficient.
                </li>
                <li>What are some of the most important lessons you learned while working on this assignment? Why do you think so?</li>
                <li> What was the most challenging aspect of this assignment? Why?</li>
            </ol>
        </p>


       <h3>4. Instructions</h3>
       <ol>
            <li>Implement the phases</li>
            <li>Test your code with the AccessibilityHeapTest.java file. </li>
            <li>Push the final project, plan.txt, and reflection.txt to github.</li>
        </ol>
