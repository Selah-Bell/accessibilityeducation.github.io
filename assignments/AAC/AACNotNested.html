                        <h3>Details</h3>
                        <p>There are many disabilities that affect a person's ability to speak.&nbsp;For instance certain disabilities, such as ALS - a progressive neurodegenerative disease <a href="https://www.als.org/understanding-als">[1]</a>, affect the muscles of the mouth, causing slurred speech or the inability to talk. Other disabilities may include developmental delays that affect a person's speech. As such, alternatives to verbal communication are often sought. These alternatives are referred to as Augmented and Alternative Communication Systems (AACs). An AAC can be either high-tech or low/no-tech. An example of low/no-tech options might be a pointing to printed pictures to communicate an idea or writing on paper to communicate.</p>
<p>However, technology can provide different options for those with speech impairments to communicate. One of the most famous people to use an AAC is Stephen Hawking. His AAC would speak aloud what he typed and was extremely high tech, combining sensors to use a facial muscle to control an interface and artificial intelligence to aid text prediction, decreasing the amount that he needed to type. Below is a short video highlighting the technology behind his AAC.&nbsp;</p>

<p>While many AACs require a user to type out what they want spoken, there are also AACs that rely on symbols for communication. An example of these types of AACs is shown in the picture below.</p>

<p>With symbol based AACs, when the user clicks on the image, the device speaks aloud the text that represents that image. For this assignment, we will work to create a simple version of an AAC device like the one shown above.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Getting Started</h4>
                        
<p>First, you will want to make sure that the text to speech library, FreeTTS, is working so that we can create a working simple AAC.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Run the TextSpeech Driver class to ensure the text to speech engine is working. Code from: <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/converting-text-speech-java/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/converting-text-speech-java/</a></p>

                        <p><em>Note: This section is only needed if you are not using Github to share your assignments with the students. If they are pulling from Github, the library should be set up in Eclipse.</em></p>
                        <p>To Install Library in Eclipse:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Click Build Path -&gt; Add Libraries</li>
    <li>Select User Library</li>
    <li>Check FreeTTS</li>
</ol>
                      <h4>Programming Details</h4>
<p>You have been given the following classes to represent the the logic of the AAC. The class should use HashMaps to store the mappings. You have been provided a GUI Class,&nbsp;<code>AAC</code>, which creates a graphical interface which displays the images and speaks the text aloud. The AAC will have a page that shows all the images that are on the AAC. When a user clicks on one of these images, the text associated with that image is spoken aloud.&nbsp; In order for the AAC class to work, you will need to implement one class, <a class="inline_disabled" href="https://accessibilityeducation.github.io/assignments/AAC/AACMappingsNotNested.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AACMappings</a> which is described below.</p>

<h4>AACMapping</h4>
<p>This is the class the keeps track of the complete set of AAC mappings. It will store the mapping of the images to the text to be spoken.</p>
<p>The AACMapping constructor takes a file that will be in the following format. In the file, each line will represent one item. It will have the file location first (will be one "word") and then the text to be spoken.  A sample file with 4 items is shown below.</p>
<pre>img/food/plate.png food<br />img/food/icons8-french-fries-96.png french fries<br />img/food/icons8-watermelon-96.png watermelon<br />img/clothing/collaredshirt.png collared shirt</pre>
<p>Then each of the items that is in the category will follow and the line will start with a "&gt;". The line will then have the file location (will be one "word") and then the text to speak.&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
    <li><code>constructor -&nbsp;</code>this method should read in the file and create the relevant mappings from images to text to be spoken</li>
    <li><code>add</code> - should add the image and text to the mapping</li>
    
    <li><code>getImageLocs -&nbsp;</code>it should return an array of the images AAC</li>
    <li><code>getText -&nbsp;</code>given an image, it will either return the text to be spoken that is associated with that image. If the image is not found, it will throw the ElementNotFoundException</li>
    <li><code>writeToFile -&nbsp;</code>writes the AACMappings in the same format that they are read in</li>
</ul>
<p>Make sure you include the comments from the Javadoc and use good style.</p>
