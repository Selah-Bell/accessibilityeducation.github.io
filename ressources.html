        app, or other digital properties accessible to people with various kinds of disabilities.
        The guidelines specify what to look for when designing or reviewing a website, application, or digital document
        for accessibility barriers

      <p class="description">With over 2.2 billion people affected by a visual impairment, failing to design with
        accessible colors in mind is one costly, exclusionary mistake to make.
        So to help you appeal to your whole audience, I’ve done a deep dive into all aspects of accessible colors.

      </a>
      <p class="description">Color enhances the design and appearance of information on the web. Although color may be a
        great tool to visually convey information, it may also create accessibility barriers.
        When color is utilized on a web page, to ensure accessibility, the right color contrast must always be
        identified and color should never be the only means to convey information.
